When I write my blog posts, I usually just end up just swiping thumbnail pictures from my website's search results for simplicity in workflow. Now you can do this too!

This plugin makes things *really* convenient when it comes to finding pictures fast and inserting them in desired fashion. The jQuery animated interface makes the process pretty fun too. Hopefully the plugin interface is self-explanatory enough where I don't have to give a huge rundown. 



== Installation ==



1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory



2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress



3. Plugin will appear under your Posts and Pages editing area, in admin interface.



== Frequently Asked Questions ==



= I push enter after typing my search terms, but nothing happens. =



Simply push "search_images" with mouse after typing your search terms.

The enter key is disabled in this plugin box because it uses AJAX, a system that fetches content dynamically without needing a page refresh. The Enter key triggers a browser refresh, which can be slow and annoying...totally against the aim of this plugin.



= When I search, I get no results...the loading bar just sticks -- no results are shown! =



This may be the rare occurance where my website is down. It will be available again shortly. Another problem may be AJAX itself not working on your particular wordpress install due to other plugins or settings.



= Do I have to keep the link or copyright notice under the image? = 



The image sizes this plugin utilizes are free. While I do not absolutely require a href="back-to-me" backlink in their use, crediting the website "ClipArtIllustration.com" is required at least. I understand SEO concerns of webmasters, so I've tried to keep requirements minimal. 

If you wish to credit ClipArtIllustration.com at the bottom of your blog post instead of doing it under every picture, you are welcome to do so. And of course you have my appreciation for your efforts in this regard.



= Are bigger images available? =

Yes, they can be found on my website: http://www.clipartillustration.com/
